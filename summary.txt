Introduction:
The project focuses on analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data from 2008 to 2020, covering 816 matches. It includes exploratory data analysis and a predictive model to determine match outcomes using machine learning.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Venue & City Insights:
  - Mumbai hosted the most matches, followed by Delhi and Kolkata.
  - Eden Gardens is the most popular venue.

- Player Performance:
  - AB de Villiers has the highest "Player of the Match" awards.

- Trend Analysis:
  - Match counts increased until 2013 and peaked again in 2022.
  - Most matches are played in April and May.

- Team Performance:
  - Gujarat Titans have the highest win percentage, followed by CSK and LSG.

- Toss Impact:
  - Teams that field first after winning the toss have higher win rates.

- Match Margins:
  - Most matches are closely contested, with narrow win margins.

- Umpires:
  - S Ravi and AK Chaudhary officiated the most matches.

- Result Types:
  - 53% matches won by wickets, 45.7% by runs, and 1.3% ended in ties.

- Feature Correlation:
  - Heatmaps were used to identify correlations and missing values.

Machine Learning Model:
- Objective: Predict the winning team using match-specific features.
- Model: LightGBM Classifier
- Input Features:
  - Venue, Batting Team, Bowling Team, Toss Winner & Decision, Runs Left, Balls Left, Wickets, Total Runs, CRR, RRR
- Output: 
  - Binary classification (1 = Batting team wins, 0 = Bowling team wins)

- Sample Prediction:
  - Mumbai Indians vs. Chennai Super Kings
  - Prediction: 1 â†’ Mumbai Indians are predicted to win

Conclusion:
The model successfully leverages match context and historical data to predict IPL outcomes. It aids strategic decisions for analysts, coaches, and management, enhancing competitive performance.
